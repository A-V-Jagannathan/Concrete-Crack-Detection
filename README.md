# Bridge Crack Detection using Deep Learning

# Description

This project aims to detect cracks in concrete surfaces in bridge engineering using a deep learning approach. The solution employs a transfer learning based approach using the VGG16 model as a base, and utilizes an open source dataset. The final layers of the VGG16 model were replaced with a dense layer and an output layer to adapt it to the problem at hand. The model's performance was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score as the judging metrics.
